üö® Tuberculosis X-Ray Prediction API

A deep learning project to detect Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch. This repository also includes a FastAPI-based REST API linked with a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend to upload X-ray images and display predictions directly on the web page.

üöÄ Project Overview

This project uses a CNN to classify chest X-ray images as either **Normal** or **Tuberculosis Positive**. The model is trained on labeled chest X-ray images, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the performance.

The FastAPI service provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading chest X-ray images and receiving TB prediction results in real-time. It is integrated with a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to upload images through a web page, send them to the backend API, and display the prediction results immediately.

üß† Model Architecture

* CNN Model: A simple two-layer convolutional network with max pooling and fully connected layers.
* Input images resized to 224x224 pixels.
* Outputs binary classification: 0 = Normal, 1 = TB Positive.
* Trained with CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer.

---

üìä Model Training and Evaluation

* Dataset split: 80% training, 20% testing.
* Metrics computed on the test set:

  * Accuracy
  * Confusion Matrix (visualized with seaborn heatmap)
  * Precision, Recall, and F1-score can be added for detailed analysis.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install and setup the project, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dabster108/Tuberculosis-X-ray-Prediction.git
cd Tuberculosis-X-ray-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

üõ† Usage

1. Training the Model

Run the training script (e.g., `train.py`):

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:

* Load and preprocess the dataset.
* Train the CNN model for a specified number of epochs.
* Evaluate the model on the test set.
* Save the trained model weights as `tuber_model.pth`.

2. Running the API Server with Frontend

Start the FastAPI server that serves both the API and the frontend web page:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend will handle image uploads both via API and the web interface.

3. Accessing the Frontend

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```

*FastAPI Swagger UI showing API documentation and endpoints.*

You will see a simple web page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where you can:

* Upload chest X-ray images.
* The frontend sends the image to the FastAPI backend.
* The prediction (Normal or TB Positive) will be displayed on the page instantly.

üì∑ Prediction Examples

![Tuberculosis Positive Chest X-Ray](./assets/tuber2.png)
*Predicted: Tuberculosis Positive*

![Normal Chest X-Ray](./assets/tuber3.png)
*Predicted: Normal*

üìà Example Prediction Output from API or Frontend

```json
{
  "prediction": "TB Positive",
}
```

---

üìâ Evaluation Metrics

You can extend evaluation by calculating:

* Accuracy: Overall correct predictions / total samples
* Precision: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
* Recall: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
* F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

Using scikit-learn‚Äôs `classification_report` can give you these metrics easily.

üóÇ Dataset Structure

* Normal/ ‚Äî Folder containing normal chest X-ray images
* Tuberculosis/ ‚Äî Folder containing TB-positive chest X-ray images

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* You can replace the CNN model architecture with your own or pretrained models.
* Adjust batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs in the training script as needed.
* The saved model weights (`tuber_model.pth`) are loaded by the API for inference.
* The FastAPI backend supports uploading images via REST API or the integrated web frontend.
